I was invited to present our work at School of Cyber Science and Technology of Zhejiang University. [The talk](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/D5rQHEVs-U-vTtmxYRpUSQ) is mainly about the application of mobile and ubiquitous sensing on mobile and IoT security problems.

The abstract of the talk is as follows:

Recent years have witnessed the surge of mobile and IoT devices in our life. Thanks to the fast and convenient data connection for the devices, enormous users employ mobile and IoT devices to store confidential information (e.g., ID number and CVS of credit card) or have access to customized services (e.g., recommendation). Hence, more users are concerned with the privacy protection of these devices. To address the increasing concerns, researchers explore the two domains of the ubiquitous security for mobile and IoT devices, i.e., defense and attack. Existing studies design user authentication (such as fingerprint, face recognition, voiceprint, etc) to defend user privacy. But they mainly rely on physiological characteristics, which easily suffer from replay attacks. As the other side, recent researches also reveal many potential side-channel attacks leveraging mobile and IoT devices in order to arouse self-consciousness of user privacy. This talk will present three of our work, including a mobile user authentication, a mobile side-channel attack, and an IoT-based continuous authentication for smart home. These works employ wireless signals (including acoustics and WiFi) to sense the human activity and explore underlying metrics to realize user authentication and side-channel attacks. Such approaches help users to understand the potential risk when using mobile and IoT devices, and provide relative solutions for privacy protection.
