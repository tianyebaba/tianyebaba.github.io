IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication and Networking is a famous international conference in sensing and communication. IEEE SECON is also a CCF-B conference.

Abstract: Multipath profiling is to characterize multipath components of wireless channels, which can be done using Channel State Information (CSI) from WiFi devices. To do so with satisfactory accuracy, recent studies rely on either a large number of receiving antennas or large bandwidth. However, it is difficult for commodity WiFi devices to meet these requirements. In this paper, we propose a scheme, WiZoom, that can perform accurate multipath profiling using single-band CSI from commodity WiFi devices.
