Abstract: To prevent users' privacy from leakage, more and more mobile devices employ biometric-based authentication approaches, such as fingerprint, face recognition, voiceprint authentications, and so on, to enhance the privacy protection. However, these approaches are vulnerable to replay attacks. Although the state-of-art solutions utilize liveness verification to combat the attacks, existing approaches are sensitive to ambient environments, such as ambient lights and surrounding audible noises. Toward this end, we explore liveness verification of user authentication leveraging users' mouth movements, which are robust to noisy environments. In this paper, we propose a lip reading-based user authentication system, LipPass, which extracts unique behavioral characteristics of users' speaking mouths through acoustic sensing on smartphones for user authentication.
