Abstract: The development of smart homes has advanced the concept of user authentication to not only protecting user privacy but also facilitating personalized services to users. Along this direction, we propose to integrate user authentication with human-computer interactions between users and smart household appliances through widely-deployed WiFi infrastructures, which is non-intrusive and device-free. In this paper, we propose Fin–¥erPass which leverages channel state information (CSI) of surrounding WiFi signals to continuously authenticate users through finger gestures in smart homes.
