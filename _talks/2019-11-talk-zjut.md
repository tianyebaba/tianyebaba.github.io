I was invited to present our work at College of Information Engineering of Zhejiang University of Technology. [The talk](http://www.ie.zjut.edu.cn/xxgcxy/jsp/news.jsp?neId=15696) is mainly about the application of mobile and ubiquitous sensing on cyber security and privacy problems.

The abstract of the talk is as follows:

Recent years have witnessed the surge of mobile devices in our life. Thanks to the fast and convenient data connection of mobile devices, enormous users employ the devices as the frequent storage medium of their confidential information, such as personal (e.g., ID number) and financial (e.g., CVS of credit card) information. Hence, more and more users are concerned with the privacy protection of mobile devices. The ubiquitous security and privacy problem of mobile devices can be divided into two domains, i.e., defense and attack. Existing studies about defense focus on designing user authentication system, such as fingerprint, face recognition, voiceprint, etc. But they mainly rely on the physiological characteristics, which easily suffer from replay attacks. As the other side, recent researches also reveal many potential side-channel attacks leveraging mobile devices in order to arouse the privacy concern of users. This talk will present three of our work, including a lip reading-based user authentication, an acoustic-based side-channel attack, and a finger gesture-based continuous authentication for smart home. These work employ the wireless signals (including acoustics and WiFi) to sense the human activity and explore the underlying metrics to realize user authentication and side-channel attacks. Such approaches help users to understand the potential risk when using mobile devices and propose probable solutions for privacy protection.
