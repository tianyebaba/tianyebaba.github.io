In IEEE SECON 2019, except for this paper, I also present three other papers for the authors who cannot go to Boston due to visa reasons.

Multipath profiling is to characterize multipath components of wireless channels, which can be done using Channel State Information (CSI) from WiFi devices. To do so with satisfactory accuracy, recent studies rely on either a large number of receiving antennas or large bandwidth. However, it is difficult for commodity WiFi devices to meet these requirements. In this paper, we propose a scheme, WiZoom, that can perform accurate multipath profiling using single-band CSI from commodity WiFi devices. In order to achieve accurate multipath profiling with limited bandwidth, WiZoom first incorporates the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm with CSI to estimate ToAs of multipath components, and then combines multiple antennas to improve the resolution of ToA estimation. WiZoom further estimates attenuations and phase shifts for multipath components using the ToAs. So far, multipath components are fully characterized, and all these estimated parameters form the multipath profile.
